## PETROOM : Pet hotel rent service for animals

Petroom was my first professional project in my career. It has designed for animal owners to take care of their pets when they are not home or they are busy. Petroom creates environment where pet hotels and animal owner can find each other. It has a reservation system and after taking hotel service, customers can vote their hotel. I designed Petroom with `Adobe XD` and wrote in `Java` with `Android Studio`. Also I'd helped to develop it's web services with `Visual Basic`. I've learnt how to work with rest api and writing web service. You can see below some screenshots from Petroom.
