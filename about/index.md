## Eyyüp ALKIŞ - Android Developer

I was born in 1994 in a charming neighborhood of Şanlı Urfa. I completed my secondary and high school education in Gaziantep. In 2013, I gained Biomedical Engineering from Namık Kemal University. And after completing one year of English preparatory studies at the same university, I started my undergraduate education in 2014 and completed it in 2018. I'm currently working for more than a year IWT (Istanbul Web Design) is actively developing android projects.te

Although my study area is biomedical engineering, my discovery of my interest in software development, corresponds to these years. I've been introduced coding with algorithms, variables information and C / C ++ syntax during my study. After that, I wrote robotics projects with Arduino in C language. In the summer of 2015,while I was taking voluntary internship, I was introduced to the principles of C # and OOP. Software became a deeper passion as I learned more. I met with the mobile world due to an application that I plan to make in the following months. The hardware I had, led me to the Android platform. And I've spent all of my spare time to learn the basics of android and to design the application which I would like to develop. I took a lot of online courses about android development till the my graduation. There was a last obstacle between me and my graduation, was mandatory internship. Then I decided to do it out of country and I applied Erasmus Internship program. I succeeded it and I found a company in Estonia which accepted my internship, was Cognuse. That was my first time to had to face with real world problems on android applications. I've worked on several projects at Cognuse. This internship was turning point of my life. I realized I want to build my professional career on software development. So I took many other online classes and more. I met with Jetpack Components, MVVM architecture pattern, UX-UI patterns, Rest Api tricks , clean code. Later, I turned back to Turkey and found a job as an android developer. And I've been developing android project since over a year. And these days I am trying to learn and apply to my projects RxJava, Dagger2 and Mockito besides android development. So I want to write down my experiences as a blog. I am planning to write my projects, mistakes, own-writed methods as I learnt. Because of lack of Turkish source about android development, I decide to write in Turkish.
